There isn't currently an official release date on the table, although we do now know that season four won't arrive until 2022. A recent teaser only confirmed that "the global phenomenon" will return next year, which is significantly later than fans were hoping.

Producer Shawn Levy appreciates that season four is taking longer than anyone expected, including him, but he promises that it's "worth the wait".

"I'll just say that we are long-delayed, and the Duffers and I want to share season four with the world as badly as the world wants it," he told The Hollywood Reporter
