A sinister clock ticks in the background; kids chase toy cars around a rainbow track (remember the rainbow room from season two?); someone's playing chess; a ball tumbles through pins on a pegboard; a Magic Eight Ball says "signs point to yes"; there's some spooky child laughter; toy bricks; everything's very echoey and lit in the institutional greeny-grey we've come to expect of bad experimental government agencies. 
The kids all have shaved heads and hospital gowns like Eleven used to in series one.
